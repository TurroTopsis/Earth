      <p id = 'text'>&#160;&#160;Spanning nearly 17 million acres of southeast Alaska, the Tongass National Forest is the largest national forest in the US. Last Friday, the Trump administration finalized its plans to open up the forest to more development and roads. The Department of Agriculture published a revised environmental impact study to &#34;fully exempt the Tongass National Forest from the 2001 Roadless Rule&#34;, effectively opening up nine million acres to development. 168,000 acres of old-growth and 20,000 acres of new-growth forest would be opened to logging.<br>&#160;&#160;Supporters of the plan include the timber industry, who say it will provide them &#34;much-needed flexibility in a difficult global market&#34;. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said of the Roadless Rule, &#34;It should never have been applied to our state, and it is harming our ability to develop a sustainable, year-round economy for the Southeast region, where less than one percent of the land is privately held&#34;.<br>&#160;&#160;Opposing the plan is the salmon industry, which generates $986 million annually. 40 percent of wild salmon in the West Coast spawn in the creeks and streams of the Tongass. They have a direct relation to the trees; salmon bring nutrients that sustain forest growth and the trees in turn cool down the water and trap sediments. Environmentalists and nature enthusiasts alike do not see any benefits from President Trump&#39;s latest environmental rollback. They point out that the trees provide critical habitat for wildlife. The Tongass makes up one third of all old-growth temperate rainforest left on the Earth. Along with the woods, the national forest encompasses glaciers, fjords, wetland, alpine tundra, mountains, and pristine rivers, lakes, and creeks teeming with salmon. With such vastly different ecosystems, the diversity is astounding. Brown bears, black bears, gray wolves, Sitka black-tailed deer, mountain goats, river otters, bald eagles, even orcas and humpback whales abound.</p>

    <p id = 'text'>&#160;&#160;An easily overlooked aspect of the forest is its crucial role as a carbon sink. Holding 8% of all carbon stored across the country&#39;s forests, Tongass is recognized as a &#34;globally significant carbon-storage reserve&#34; by the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. Scientist Dominick DellaSala of the Earth Island Institute calculated that carbon dioxide emissions from logging the 160,00 acres of old-growth forest in the Tongass would create greenhouse gases equivalent to adding 10 million cars to the road. DellaSala criticized the Forest Service&#39;s decision as founded on &#34;junk science&#34; without any data to back their analysis.<br>&#160;&#160;Like many of the President&#39;s other environmental rollbacks, the protections to the Tongass could be put back in place if former Vice President Joseph R. Biden wins the presidency.  The future of the Tongass and countless other federal lands depend on the November 3 election.</p>
