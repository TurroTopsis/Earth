      <p id = 'text'>&#160;&#160;Fast Fashion is destroying our planet, and people need to be educated about the effects of thoughtlessly buying cheap, unnecessary clothing and accessories. Fashion is overlooked a lot of the time when it comes to speaking about climate change, when it&#39;s one of the main factors. Up until the 1960s, climate change was not a major problem- but that changed drastically when young people began to follow fashion trends more closely than just dressing for the seasons. According to <i>The Good Trade</i>, &#34;Fast fashion utilizes trend replication, rapid production, and low quality materials in order to bring inexpensive styles to the public...&#34; this inevitably leads to underpaid workers, harmful impacts to the environment, etc.&#34; Because of the extremely high demand for trendy clothing and the way that trends pass so quickly, corners are being cut. Additionally, because most of the clothing that is being bought from these fast fashion companies are so trendy, the piece of clothing you thought was so cute that month, will probably only get worn a few times before the next trend comes along that is so much cuter than the last. <i>Fashionista</i> states, &#34;...fashion brands had to find ways to keep up with this increasing demand for affordable clothing, leading to massive textile mills opening across the developing world, which allowed the U.S. and European companies to save millions of dollars by outsourcing their labor. There are catastrophic amounts of waste due to fast fashion - according to the <i>True Cost Movie</i> directed by Andrew Morgan explains that in the U.S. alone, 11 million tons of clothing are simply being thrown away. Most of these garments are full of pesticides, lead, and countless other chemicals that don&#39;t break down and are releasing toxic chemicals into the air.<br>&#160;&#160;Not only is climate change being impacted by fast fashion, human rights are being violated.<br>&#160;&#160;To sum it up, trend replication, rapid production, low quality, and competitive pricing add up to having a large impact on the environment and the people involved in its production. This is why people need to be educated and reminded about why the fight against fast fashion is so important and to help spread awareness of ethical consumption.<br><u>Works Cited</u><br>Idacavage, Sara. &#34;Fashion History Lesson: The Origins of Fast Fashion.&#34; <i>Fashionista</i>, 8 June 2016, <a href = 'https://www.fashionista.com/2016/06/what-is-fast-fashion'>https://www.fashionista.com/2016/06/what-is-fast-fashion</a>.<br>&#34;The Problem with Fast Fashion.&#34; <i>BWSS</i>, 27 Aug. 2019, <a href = 'https://www.bwss.org/fastfashion/'>https://www.bwss.org/fastfashion</a>.<br>Schlossberg, Tatiana. &#34;How Fast Fashion Is Destroying the Planet.&#34; <i>The New York Times</i>, The New York Times, 3 Sept. 2019, <a href = 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/books/review/how-fast-fashion-is-destroying-the-planet.html'>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/books/review/how-fast-fashion-is-destroying-the-planet.html</a>.<br>Stanton, Audrey. &#34;What Is Fast Fashion, Anyway?&#34; <i>The Good Trade</i>, The Good Trade, 24 Apr. 2020, <a href = 'https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/what-is-fast-fashion'>https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/what-is-fast-fashion</a>.</p>
