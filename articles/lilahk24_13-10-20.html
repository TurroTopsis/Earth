      <h3>A Note on Global Warming</h3>
      <h6>By: Lilah Keating</h6>

      <p id = 'text'>&#160;&#160;There is an ongoing debate about whether the human species is primarily responsible for global climate change, and what lengths should be done to stop it. However, substantial evidence has proven that humans are the primary cause for global warming and are not doing enough to prevent it from getting worse. The amounts of greenhouse gasses that are being released are growing and more heat is being trapped on earth and causing global temperatures to rise. The gasses are causing arctic ice caps to melt at an increasing rate, and causes water levels to rise. Humans are also responsible for the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere, and is occurring at a rate much faster than natural climate changes could produce. Overall, Humans are responsible for global warming and need to do something about all of the mess that they have caused.<br>&#160;&#160;One of the main causes of global warming in the release of greenhouse gasses which cause unwanted heat to get trapped and cause the planet to heat up. Humans are releasing gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in substantial amounts. Then, when sunlight hits the earth&#39;s surface, these gasses absorb the heat and cause the planet to heat up. Since 1751, an estimated amount of around 337 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide have been released by humans. Imagine how much heat is now forever trapped on our planet. This is having countless negative chain reactions such as heat waves, droughts, ice caps melting, sea levels rising, heavier storms, less snow, and numberless more. This has all been caused by careless humans, and the more aghast thing is that we as a species are doing hardly anything about it. Many man-made gasses are continuing to be released in substantial amounts. Man continues to release fosse fuels, into the environment, to continue using gas powered vehicles, and continue to cut down wildlife that helps get rid of these awful glasses. Even though there are many other ways to harvest and use energy, such as wind, wave, or sun energy, large company owners continue to choose these environment hurtful methods because they are cheaper and push aside the fact that they are killing our planet.<br>&#160;&#160;One of the main causes of our planet being warmer than it needs to be is because too much of the substance CO2 is being produced. According to <i>The Scripps Institution of Oceanology</i>, the &#34;extreme speed at which carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing is unprecedented.&#34; This is saying that the release of carbon dioxide is much higher than it needs to be. CO2, like coal and oil, is a fossil fuel. However, the substantial amounts of CO2 in our atmosphere is causing many more problems than any other substance. To continue, the rising levels of CO2 are resulted from human activity, primarily from cars and generators. The problems that we have now used to not be substantial issues. Plants and wildlife used the carbon dioxide that we released to make their food. They would then release oxygen into the air, which we need to breathe. It was a perfect  system that benefited both mankind and  However, in our modern time, not only is humanity cutting down the wildlife that would absorb the CO2, they are also releasing too much of it for the plants to use. The exas CO2 then goes into the atmosphere, where it absorbs and traps the sun&#39;s heat and causes the earth&#39;s temperature to rise. The human race is clearly causing this themselves, and are in turn killing our planet.<br>&#160;&#160;Sure, CO2 and other greenhouse gasses are being released. So what? Why should humans have to change our whole lifestyle just because the planet is getting a little warmer? Actually, humans should be a lot more worried about the planet&#39;s temperature rising then they are. The heating of our planet is causing ice glaciers to melt, which not only causes problems for wildlife in these cold environments, it also is causing problems for our own species. When the ice melts, the water levels in bodies of water rise. This causes a chair reaction of problems such as land being covered in water, the PH level of water rising, and worsening storms. The heat that is being trapped on earth by these glasses are causing droughts, less and less snow, and heat waves. Essentially, the planet is heating up to a level that is dangerous to its inhabitants. With the water levels rising, cities like Venice are predicted to be underwater by 2100. Another problem that is being caused is that arctic ice, which used to reflect the sun&#39;s rays back into space, no longer are able to. With less arctic ice to reflect the sun&#39;s rays, more heat is being trapped on earth which is causing global warming to progress even further than it already was. Oceanic acidity has changed in such a way where it is treating the survival of many marine species. This is causing the sea ecosystems to collapse, which again causes a chain reaction of events. One of these is that with the warmer ocean water, there is increased intensity to storm systems. Altogether, gasses released by mankind is causing the arctic ice caps to melt and cause a chain of reactions of more problems.<br>&#160;&#160;The human species is clearly responsible for the global warming of our planet and instead of owning up to it and doing something about it, the problems continue to grow. Greenhouse gasses that are released, from mostly human made cars and generators, are trapping heat on our planet causing it to heat up. The most destructive of the gasses is Carbon Dioxide. There is an abundance of this gas in the atmosphere and is causing all kinds of problems. The rising heat level of our planet is causing arctic ice caps to melt and cause terrible storms, and trouble with the oceanic life ecosystem. Overall, humans are completely responsible for the destruction of our planet by releasing greenhouse gasses, primarily carbon dioxide, that trap heat on our planet, causing temperatures to rise and ice glaciers to melt. The human species needs to own up for the destruction of our planet and do something about it.<br><u>Works Cited</u><br>&#34;Pros & Cons - ProCon.org.&#34; <i>Climate Change</i>, <a href = 'https://www.climatechange.procon.org/'>https://www.climatechange.procon.org/</a>.<br>&#34;Pros and Cons on &#39;Negative Emissions&#39; Prospects &#34; Yale Climate Connections.&#34; <i>Yale Climate Connections</i>, 27 Oct. 2018, <a href = 'https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2017/05/pros-and-cons-on-negative-emissions-prospects/'>https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2017/05/pros-and-cons-on-negative-emissions-prospects/</a>.<br>&#34;What Is the Most Harmful Human Action to Earth: AMNH.&#34; <i>American Museum of Natural History</i>, <a href = 'https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/earth/ask-a-scientist-about-our-environment/what-is-the-most-harmful-human-action-to-earth';>https:// www.amnh.org/explore/ology/earth/ask-a-scientist-about-our-environment/what-is-the-most-harmful-human-action-to-earth</a>.</p>
