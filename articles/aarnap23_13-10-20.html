      <p id = 'text'>&#160;&#160;I could argue that pesticides are an example of chemical warfare. . . except, instead of targeting soldiers on the battlefield, pesticides attack plants, insects, rodents, bacteria, and fungi. Does it make sense to use a <i>chemical weapon</i> to get rid of a few weeds? Some may argue we should use pesticides because they work well, but it&#39;s no wonder pesticides are so effective - chemists spend years honing them to be effective killers. It is actually scary how much time and money goes into developing these chemical weapons; but what is even more frightening is how little effort goes into ensuring pesticides are safe for the environment, other organisms, and even humans! Let&#39;s take a look at three pesticides, how they work, and their devastating effects.<br>&#160;&#160;Organophosphates (Figure I) are a group of insecticides that target the nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that catalyzes (breaks down) the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. By doing so, these pesticides prevent normal nervous function, killing unwanted insects. But the thing is, acetylcholinesterase is crucial in many organisms other than insects: birds, dogs, cats, humans, and more are negatively affected from exposure to organophosphates.<br>&#160;&#160;The herbicide group sulfonylureas (Figure II) kills weeds by inhibiting the plant enzyme acetolactate synthase, preventing the amino acids valine, isoleucine, and leucine from being produced. Without these crucial protein building-blocks, the plant will die. But these herbicides do not only kill weeds: when they runoff into lakes and rivers, they adversely affect aquatic plant life. Also, humans exposed to sulfonylurea herbicides reported cardiovascular issues.<br>&#160;&#160;I&#39;ve saved the worst for last: organochlorine insecticides (Figure III). Similar to organophosphates, they kill insects by preventing normal nervous function. The notorious organophosphate DDT prevents Na+ channels in the peripheral nervous system, causing tremors, seizures, and, finally, death. When humans and other animals are exposed to DDT, they experience these awful symptoms, too. What&#39;s more, DDT persists in the environment for a long time (the soil half-life is 2-15 years!), wreaking havoc on local wildlife. When DDT was used in the 1940s and &#39;50s, the population of bald eagle and other beloved birds crashed; the chemical thinned egg shells, killing their embryos. Luckily, DDT was banned in 1972, but it goes to show how little thought goes into ensuring pesticides are <i>actually</i> safe.<br>&#160;&#160;Just like chemical weapons, pesticides will kill what they are meant to, but they have unintended consequences: they are <i>awful</i> for the environment, can harm other organisms, and lead to adverse health effects in humans. So next time you see a pesticide sign, know that it should really be a chemical hazard sign.</p>
